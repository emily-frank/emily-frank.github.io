## Peer-Reviewed Journal Publications:

1.  **Legal Status and Refugees' Perceptions of Institutional Justice: The Role of Communication Quality**, with Anton Nivorozhkin (Institut für Arbeitsmarkt- und Berufsforschung, IAB) (recently accepted for publication)<br>
Refugees with an insecure legal status report poorer experiences of procedural justice at bureaucratic agencies; interactions with street-level bureaucrats partially mediate the relationship between legal status and procedural justice.

3. **[Determinants of Welfare Use of Immigrant Groups - Longitudinal Evidence from Germany](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fsoc.2022.839352/full)** (2022). Frontiers in Sociology, Migration and Society (7). doi: 10.3389/fsoc.2022.839352 <br>

## Book reviews: 

1. **[Beyond their years: Unaccompanied minors and the social construction of categories](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=VBPtJPMAAAAJ&citation_for_view=VBPtJPMAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C)** (2023). Culture, Practice & Europeanization 8 (2), p. 264-266. doi: 10.5771/2566-7742-2023-2-264 <br>

## Under review:

1. **“A Normal Refugee”?: Civic Stratification and the Stratification of Belonging**<br>
Dissertation project demonstrating how changing policy responses in Germany have led to the selective inclusion of refugees in social rights (civic stratification) and how these policies have impacted refugees' sense of belonging, drawing on interviews.

2. **Penny for Your Thoughts: The Income Divide in Media Effects on Immigration Attitudes**<br>
Paper for the Migration & Sozialstaat project, combining quantitative text analysis of newspaper content with regression analysis of public opinion data. Results demonstrate that high-income individuals, while they hold more positive immigration attitudes overall, are more likely to hold somewhat more negative attitudes at times of high media salience. 

3. **Paper Walls: Administrative Burden and the Unequal Inclusion of Refugees**<br>
Dissertation project demonstrating how refugees with a precarious legal status in Germany experience systematically greater administrative burdens when accessing welfare state resources, resulting in differential inclusion in social rights. 

4. **Not in My Backyard: Unraveling Local Dynamics of Welfare Chauvinism** <br>
Paper for the Migration & Sozialstaat project utilizing survey data to analyze welfare use and attitudes at the local district level. Regression results demonstrate a relationship between refugee population size and attitudes, but no link between refugees' welfare use and attitudes.

## In progress: 

1. **A Causal Link Between Receiving the Asylum Decision and Mental Health**
   
2. **Family Reunification and Mental Health**
   
3. **Multimorbidity of Immigrant Groups**, with Alessandro Ferrara (WZB)
