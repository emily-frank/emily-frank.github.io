## Peer-Reviewed Journal Publications:

1. **“Why it’s different?”: Hierarchies of (Non-) Belonging in German Refugee Categorizations** (2025) (recently accepted for publication at *Journal of Immigrant & Refugee Studies*).<br>
Differential inclusion in rights creates hierarchical levels of non-belonging, with the example of refugees' rights to access the labor market in Germany. 

2.  **[Legal Status and Refugees' Perceptions of Institutional Justice: The Role of Communication Quality](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/puar.13898)**, with Anton Nivorozhkin (Institut für Arbeitsmarkt- und Berufsforschung, IAB) (2024). *Public Administration Review*. doi: 10.1111/puar.13898<br>
Refugees with an insecure legal status report poorer experiences of procedural justice at bureaucratic agencies; interactions with street-level bureaucrats partially mediate the relationship between legal status and procedural justice.

3. **[Bureaucracy as Borders: Refugees’ Experiences of Citizenship at Government Offices](https://opus4.kobv.de/opus4-hsog/frontdoor/index/index/docId/5610)** (2024), doctoral thesis, Hertie School. <br>

4. **[Determinants of Welfare Use of Immigrant Groups - Longitudinal Evidence from Germany](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fsoc.2022.839352/full)** (2022). *Frontiers in Sociology, Sec. Migration and Society* (7), Special Issue: ”The Integration Context of Refugees and Immigrants: Challenges
and Opportunities in the Receiving Countries” (edited by Jasper Tjaden and Zerrin Salikutluk). doi: 10.3389/fsoc.2022.839352 <br>

## Book reviews: 

1. **[Beyond their years: Unaccompanied minors and the social construction of categories](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=VBPtJPMAAAAJ&citation_for_view=VBPtJPMAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C)** (2023). *Culture, Practice & Europeanization* 8 (2), p. 264-266. doi: 10.5771/2566-7742-2023-2-264 <br>

## Under review:
1. **Paper Walls: Administrative Burden and the Unequal Inclusion of Refugees**<br>
Dissertation project demonstrating how refugees with a precarious legal status in Germany experience systematically greater administrative burdens when accessing welfare state resources, resulting in differential inclusion in social rights. 

2. **Penny for Your Thoughts: The Income Divide in Media Effects on Immigration Attitudes**<br>
Paper for the Migration & Sozialstaat project, combining quantitative text analysis of newspaper content with regression analysis of public opinion data. Results demonstrate that high-income individuals, while they hold more positive immigration attitudes overall, are more likely to hold somewhat more negative attitudes at times of high media salience. 

3. **Not in My Backyard: Unraveling Local Dynamics of Welfare Chauvinism** <br>
Paper for the Migration & Sozialstaat project utilizing survey data to analyze welfare use and attitudes at the local district level. Regression results demonstrate a relationship between refugee population size and attitudes, but no link between refugees' welfare use and attitudes.

## In progress: 

1. **A Causal Link Between Receiving the Asylum Decision and Mental Health**, with Jan Paul Heisig (WZB)
   
2. **Family Reunification and Mental Health**
   
3. **Multimorbidity of Immigrant Groups**, with Lara Bister and Alessandro Ferrara (WZB)
