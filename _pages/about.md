I am a postdoctoral research fellow at the [WZB Berlin Social Science Center](https://www.wzb.eu/en), Research Group Health and Social Inequality, where I use quantitative approaches to study immigrants' mental health as part of a project of the [Einstein Center Population Diversity](https://einstein-diversity.com/). [Our project](https://einstein-diversity.com/research/migrant-families-mental-health/) is interdisciplinary and mixed methods, focusing particularly on the role of migrants' families in shaping mental health outcomes. 

I recently completed my PhD at the Research Training Group "The Dynamics of Demography, Democratic Processes and Public Policy" ([DYNAMICS](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/dynamics)), which is jointly organized by the [Humboldt University Berlin](https://www.hu-berlin.de/en) and the [Hertie School](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/). During that time, I also a research associate at the Berlin Institute for Empirical Integration and Migration Research ([BIM](https://www.bim.hu-berlin.de/en/bim-start)), which is part of the Humboldt University Berlin. In my mixed methods dissertation, I examined refugees' experiences of citizenship (broadly speaking) at German welfare offices, the ways that social entitlements are stratified by legal status, and how this stratification affects migrants' experiences of citizenship and belonging. For my work at BIM, I focused on the role of public opinion in how the welfare state addresses immigration, conducting quantitative research on determinants of welfare chauvinism as part of a project called [Migration and the Welfare State](https://www.projekte.hu-berlin.de/de/migsoz).

I completed my bachelor's degree in sociology at New York University and my master's degree in public policy at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
