I am a doctoral researcher at the Research Training Group "The Dynamics of Demography, Democratic Processes and Public Policy" (DYNAMICS) and a PhD candidate at the Hertie School. I am also a research associate at the Berlin Institute for Empirical Integration and Migration Research (BIM), which is part of the Humboldt University of Berlin.

My main interests are in immigration, the welfare state, and mixed methods. 

For my dissertation, which is supervised by [Anke Hassel](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/research/faculty-and-researchers/profile/person/hassel), I analyze the experiences of refugees with Germany's welfare state bureaucracy. I focus on the administrative burdens refugees face when navigating the welfare system in their destination country, how welfare bureaucracies adapt to immigration, and how to approach these questions using both quantitative and qualitative methodologies.

For my work at BIM, I focus more on the role of public opinion in how the welfare state addresses immigration as part of a project called [Migration and the Welfare State](https://www.projekte.hu-berlin.de/de/migsoz). I conduct quantitative research specifically on welfare chauvinism. 

I completed my bachelor's degree in sociology at New York University and my master's degree in public policy at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
