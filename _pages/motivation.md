I would not have ended up in my specific field of research - immigration and the welfare state - without my on-the-ground experience. After completing my BA, I spent two years working as a legal advocate at an organization called the [Urban Justice Center](https://www.urbanjustice.org/). I helped social benefits recipients across New York City who were facing issues such as benefit cuts, sanctions, and case closings. I learned all the details of social benefits law, conducted a weekly legal clinic at a food pantry, prepared court cases, attended administrative hearings, and represented a caseload of about 40 clients at one time. Over two years, I won ___ in retroactive benefits and ___ in ongoing benefits for my clients and eventually became the senior advocate. 

I also developed a particular interest in the issue of language access. Many of my clients - mostly Spanish speakers - faced additional barriers to benefits access because they were not provided with services in their native language, which was their legal right under NYC law. I began attending working groups with the NYC Human Resources Administration where we discussed this topic, bringing various case examples to social service administrators in order to advocate for improved access for non-English speakers.
