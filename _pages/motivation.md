I would not have ended up in my specific field of research - immigration and the welfare state - without my on-the-ground experience. After completing my BA, I spent two years working as a legal advocate at an organization called the [Urban Justice Center](https://www.urbanjustice.org/). I helped social benefits recipients across New York City who were facing issues such as benefit cuts, sanctions, and case closings. I learned all the details of social benefits law, conducted a weekly legal clinic at a food pantry, prepared court cases, attended administrative hearings, and represented a caseload of about 40 clients at one time. Over two years, I won $440,000 in retroactive benefits and $67,000 in ongoing benefits for my clients and eventually became the senior advocate. 

I also developed a particular interest in the issue of language access. Many of my clients - mostly Spanish speakers - faced additional barriers to benefits access because they were not provided with services in their own language, which was their legal right under NYC law. In such situations, people's livelihoods were shaped not only by their legal context, but by extralegal factors such as their nationality and native tongue. In order to advocate for improved access for non-English speakers, I began attending working groups with the NYC Human Resources Administration where we discussed the topic of language access. 

My responsibilities required frequent communication with the street-level bureaucrats who work in welfare offices and administrative courts. I observed firsthand how the decisions of street-level bureaucrats can have drastic effects on the lives of social benefits recipients. Moreover, I was a street-level bureaucrat myself and could see how many aspects of my work - the amount of time I'd spend listening to the client's story, my workload, my level of patience on a given day - could potentially affect case outcomes.
